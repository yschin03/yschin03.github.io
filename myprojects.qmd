In summary, after analysing top song tracks on Spotify, here are my key findings from conducting several data visualisations:

1.  Drake and Rihanna both have the most number of featured top tracks (23) on Spotify. Despite that, the artist with the highest popularity levels of his featured songs is Eminem (72.33).

2.  Sweater Weather was the most popular song, with a popularity value of 89/100.

3.  The explicit content of a song does contribute to the popularity of the song, but to a small extent.

4.  Other song attributes like tempo, speechiness, loudness, acousticness and valence impact song popularity to a small extent. All increase song popularity except valence, which has a negative association with song popularity.

## Top Tracks in Spotify

![](images/spotify-music.gif){width="297"}

In my project, I will be analysing a dataset containing information of the **top tracks in Spotify.** This dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019), a free dataset sharing platform.

## Introduction: An overview of Spotify

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that provides access to songs and other content from many creators globally ([*What Is Spotify?*, n.d.](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/what-is-spotify/)). It is the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service with more than 602 million users, including 236 million subscribers in more than 180 markets ([*Spotify — about Spotify*, n.d.](https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/#:~:text=We%20are%20the%20world%27s%20most,in%20more%20than%20180%20markets.)).

## Why this dataset?

I have been an avid and frequent user of Spotify for quite some time. Over the years, I have developed an interest and habit of listening to top tracks within the streaming platform. Thus, I am keen to analyse the different aspects of top song hits through more in-depth data insights.

This dataset is a csv file that contains audio statistics of the top 2000 tracks on Spotify from 1998-2020. The original dataset contains 18 columns which contains the top Spotify tracks and its qualities.

## Main Problem Statement

In my [data story](https://yschin03.github.io/datastory.html), I will be analysing various song properties and their relationships with song popularity.

The main question I wish to answer is **"What determines the extent of popularity of songs in this Spotify Top Tracks dataset?"**
