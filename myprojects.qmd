## Top Tracks in Spotify (2000 to 2019)

![](images/spotify-music.gif){width="297"}

In my project, I will be analysing a dataset containing information of the **top tracks in Spotify** **between the year 2000 to 2019.** This dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019), a free dataset sharing platform.

## Introduction: An overview of Spotify

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that provides access to songs and other content from many creators globally ([*What Is Spotify?*, n.d.](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/what-is-spotify/)). It is the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service with more than 602 million users, including 236 million subscribers in more than 180 markets ([*Spotify — about Spotify*, n.d.](https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/#:~:text=We%20are%20the%20world%27s%20most,in%20more%20than%20180%20markets.)).

## Why this dataset?

I have been an avid and frequent user of Spotify for quite some time. Over the years, I have developed an interest and habit of listening to top tracks within the streaming platform. Thus, I am keen to analyse the different aspects of top song hits through more in-depth data insights.

This dataset is a csv file that contains audio statistics of the top 2000 tracks on Spotify from 2000-2019. The data contains about 18 columns each describing the track and its qualities.
