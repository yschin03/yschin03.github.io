## 1. Total number of songs versus genre (column chart)
Let us analyse the total number of songs for the top 30 genre types.



```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("df.csv")
df_grouped <- group_by(df, genre)

df_summarised <- summarise(df_grouped, song = n())

df_arranged <- arrange(df_summarised, desc(song))
df_head <- head(df_arranged, 30)

ggplot(df_head, aes(x = reorder(genre, song), y = song)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Genre", y = "Number of songs", title = "Top 30 genres by number of songs") +
  theme_minimal()

```  


## 3. Songs per year 
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Group by 'year' and count the number of songs, then sort by 'song' count in descending order and then by 'year'
df_grouped <- df %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(song = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(song), year)

df_grouped

# Create area plot
area_plot <- ggplot(df_grouped, aes(x = year, y = song, group = 1)) +
  geom_area(fill = "green", color = "green", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(color = "green", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Year by Year Songs collection", x = "Year", y = "Total songs") +
  theme_minimal() 

area_plot

```  


## 4. songs per artist top 50 (bar chart)  
```{r}

# Group by 'artist' and count the number of songs, then sort by 'song' count in descending order and select top 50
df_grouped <- df %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  summarise(song = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(song)) %>%
  head(50)
df_grouped

df_grouped$artist <- as.character(df_grouped$artist)

# Create bar plot
ggplot(df_grouped, aes(x = reorder(artist, -song), y = song, fill = artist)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "List of Songs Recorded by Each Singer", x = "Artist", y = "Total Songs") +
  geom_text(aes(label = song), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)

```  

## 5. popularity vs songs, top 25 songs (line graph - connecting the points)  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


# Arrange dataframe by 'popularity' in descending order and select top 25 rows
df_top <- df %>%
  arrange(desc(popularity)) %>%
  select(popularity, song) %>%
   head(25) 
df_top



# Create line plot
ggplot(df_top, aes(x = reorder(song, -popularity), y = popularity, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Top 25 songs in Spotify", x = "Song", y = "Popularity") +
  scale_color_manual(values = "green") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)

```
